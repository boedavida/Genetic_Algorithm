# Genetic_algorithm
A genetic algorithm or evolutionary algorithm in Matlab/Octave that solves the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem is an example of a combinatorial optimization problem. The problem asks the number of copies of items of specified weights ;that can to be placed into a knapsack to maximize the number of items without exceeding the maximum weight allowed. The 0â€“1 knapsack problem can be run as a special case.

The code was written in Matlab version 2015a. No additional toolboxes are required.

The code is a script named ga.m. Open ga.m in an application that is capable of running Matlab or Octave code. Run ga.m. The answer is output to the command window, and two figures are produced, maximum fitness score vs. generation and average fitness score vs. generation.
